        <p><b>Git</b> is a version control system. It allows the user/s the ability top to track and manage multiple changes to a file or project. Git lets a user to create a exact version of the main file (also called a branch) to amend or edit. Any changes can be reviewed by peers for approval before it is applied to the main file (merged).</p>
        <img src="Images\github.png" alt="The Github logo" height="100px">
        <p><b>Github</b> is a cloud based service to host multiple repositories. A repository is a container for maintaining files, it can interact with Git to record and keep track of the file history when any changes are made. GitHub works in conjunction with Git coordinating to host multiple projects and allow users to access these projects from anywhere. The files can be hosted to be public and open source, or closed/private for specific colleagues to work with.</p>
        <h2><b>The Github Workflow</b></h2>
        <p>When you are working on a project within a team there will most likely be a number of ideas around new features, integrations and optimization. If everybody made changes to the code without consultation, it could lead to problems with the main codes and files. The GitHub workflow makes the managing of a project much easier</p>

        <h3>The "main/master" branch</h3>
        <p>The main (also known as "master") branch is the main code/file/project where all changes eventually get merged back into. This is the official working version of your project. The master branch is meant to be stable, and it is the social contract of open source software to never, ever push anything to master that is not tested, or that breaks the build.</p>
        <h3>Creating a branch</h3>
        <p>A branch is an independent line of development and each repository will contain at least one branch. When a user is planning on making any changes to the "main" branch they can create a new branch that acts as a "child" branch. This creates an isolated environment where any changes can be made without having any affect on the existing main branch.</p>
        <h3>Commit</h3>
        <p>After a branch has been created you can start making changes. When the file has been modified that changes can be committed to the branch. Each commitment to the branch must contain an associated message explaining why the change was made which allows an history of what you have done.</p>
        <h3>Pull Requests</h3>
        <p>A pull request is a comparison of two branches. Once a commit has been made you can open a pull request and discuss any commits that have been made.After a pull request has been made users may have comments or things that they may disagree with in the project. This can give you an opportunity to make additional commits to the branch to ensure that nothing gets into the main branch without being well tested and approved.</p>
        <h3>Merge branch</h3>
        <p>After all the changes have been made in the branch and the pull request has been approved, the branch can be merged into the main branch. This will commit all of the changes that have been applied in the "child" branch and apply them to the main branch. </p>
        <br>
        <h2>The Unix Shell</h2>
        <p>The Unix shell is a medium to interact with the kernel (control of computer operations). It gathers input from a user, executes a programme based from the input and displays the outcome from the execution of the program.</p>
